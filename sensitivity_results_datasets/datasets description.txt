The data for sensitivity analysis of this case was presented as one of the examples for the Joint Sensitivity Analysis Exercise (JOSA) group.
The following analysis was carried out by IBRAE.
Parameters of the investigated model:
	- pBuffer - Buffer porosity
	- meanWPrate - Mean of the truncated log-normal distribution on base normalized general corrosion rate (R) 
	- stdWPrate - The standard deviation of the truncated log-normal distribution
	- IRF - Instant release fraction
	- rateUNF - Fractional dissolution rate of spent nuclear fuel
	- kGlacial - Glacial till permeability
	- permDRZ - Disturbed rock zone permeability
	- permBuffer - Buffer permeability
* The uncertainty in the fracture network description was accounted for using dual-loop sampling.
It means that 1000 realizations that are available for sensitivity analysis represent combinations of:
	- 25 unique spatial structures (realizations of stochastically generated discrete fracture network)
	- 40 realizations of the uncertain parameters were generated for each spatial realization.
Initial dataset also contained graph characteristics of stochastic realizations, they was not used in the current analysis.
Quantities of interest of the investigated model:
	- Peak_Total I129_M - Peak 129I concentration in the aquifer, 
	- FractionofSpikeinRepository_1My – the fraction of a tracer remaining in the repository at 1 million years, could be used as an indicator of repository retention.
	- FractionalMassFluxfromRepo_1Myr – the instantaneous fractional loss rate of tracer remaining in the repository at one million years. It is also an indicator of repository retention.
	- AqEb_RockEb_1Myr – the ratio of two water fluxes at 1 million years: the flux from the aquifer to the east boundary normalized by the flux from the rock to the east boundary.
	- RockAq_RockEb_1Myr – the ratio of another two water fluxes (upward vs. horizontal flow) at 1 million years:  the rock to the aquifer vs. the rock to the east boundary
	- Time-series of 129I concentration in the aquifer.

4 global sensitivity analysis methods with different mathematical backgrounds were used: 
	- correlation method (Spearman rank correlation coefficients) (Helton, 1993),
	- Sobol’ indices as variance-based method (Saltelli et al., 2008),
	- moment-independent method PAWN (Pianosi et al., 2015; Pianosi and Wagener, 2018)
	- Gini feature importance measures of a tree-based approximating metamodel (Breiman, 2001).
